## Project Milestones

Milestone 1: Proposal Development

A detailed project proposal was created to outline the app's objectives, target audience, and unique value proposition. The proposal emphasized the need for a comprehensive nutrition-focused application that integrates meal planning, recipe discovery, and social features.

Milestone 2: Research Plan

A structured research plan was developed to guide user research activities, focusing on understanding user behaviors, pain points, and expectations regarding healthy eating and meal planning.

Milestone 3: User Research & Insights Report

User research was conducted through surveys and interviews to gather insights into the challenges people face when maintaining a healthy diet. The research findings were compiled into an insights report, highlighting key user needs and potential features.

Milestone 4: Personas, User Stories & Low-Fidelity Prototype

Developed primary user personas to represent different user segments.

Created user stories to map out user interactions and feature requirements.

Designed low-fidelity wireframes to visualize the appâ€™s structure and functionality.

Milestone 5: High-Fidelity Prototype Development

Based on the low-fidelity prototype, a high-fidelity version was designed using Figma. This version incorporates UI elements, branding, and interactivity to create a seamless user experience.

Milestone 6: Usability Testing & User Feedback

Usability testing interviews were conducted to evaluate the high-fidelity prototype. User feedback was collected and analyzed to refine the design, improve usability, and enhance the overall user experience.
